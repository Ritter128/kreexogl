# Building and running
The build script should take care of everything; do make sure CMake nad make are installed:

    ./build.sh

Run the executable:

    ./build/KREEX

# Acknowledgements
The texture class flatout doesn't work, and I don't know why.
If someone can fix it, please do.
For now textures are hardcoded.
